In particular this applies to algebraic number fields, so any element $f$ of an algebraic number field $F$ can be written as a zero of a polynomial with rational coefficients. Therefore, elements of $F$ are also referred to as algebraic numbers.

A polynomial with this property is known as a monic polynomial. In general it will have rational coefficients. If, however, its coefficients are actually all integers, $f$ is called an algebraic integer.

For decryption, the system extracts and converts the garbled data and transforms it into words and images that are easily understandable not only by a reader but also by a system. Decryption can be done manually or automatically. It may also be performed with a set of keys or passwords."

    "Today's ciphers use either secret-key or public-key techniques. Secret-key ciphers can be used to protect critical/sensitive data. Because secret-key ciphers use a single key that users must share, this is also known as symmetric cryptography. \n",
    "\n",
    "Public-key ciphers  or asymmetric, use a pair of keys: the public key that gets shared with other people, and a corresponding private key that is kept secret by its single owner. Even if the eavesdropper gets the public key he can't duplicate the process and derive a shared key, since the eavesdroppers don't know the private keys. In that case the eavesdropper can't guess the message without knowing the private key."
