    "# ** Problem 9. Perlin Noise\n",
    "This algorithm has many applications in computer graphics and can serve to demonstrate several things... and help us learn about math, algorithms and Python :).\n",
    "#### Noise\n",
    "Noise is just random values. We can generate noise by just calling a random generator. Note that these are actually called *pseudorandom generators*. We'll talk about this later in this course.\n",
    "We can generate noise in however many dimensions we want. For example, if we want to generate a single dimension, we just pick N random values and call it a day. If we want to generate a 2D noise space, we can take an approach which is similar to what we already did with `np.meshgrid()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{noise}(x, y) = N, N \\in [n_{min}, n_{max}] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes two coordinates and returns a single number N between $n_{min}$ and $n_{max}$. (This is what we call a \"scalar field\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variables are always connected to **distributions**. We'll talk about these a great deal but now let's just say that these define what our noise will look like. In the most basic case, we can have \"uniform noise\" - that is, each point in our little noise space $[n_{min}, n_{max}]$ will have an equal chance (probability) of being selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Perlin noise\n",
    "There are many more distributions but right now we'll want to have a look at a particular one. **Perlin noise** is a kind of noise which looks smooth. It looks cool, especially if it's colored. The output may be tweaked to look like clouds, fire, etc. 3D Perlin noise is most widely used to generate random terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm\n",
    "... Now you're on your own :). Research how the algorithm is implemented (note that this will require that you understand some other basic concepts like vectors and gradients).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your task\n",
    "1. Research about the problem. See what articles, papers, Python notebooks, demos, etc. other people have created\n",
    "2. Create a new notebook and document your findings. Include any assumptions, models, formulas, etc. that you're using\n",
    "3. Implement the algorithm. Try not to copy others' work, rather try to do it on your own using the model you've created\n",
    "4. Test and improve the algorithm\n",
    "5. (Optional) Create a cool demo :), e.g. using Perlin noise to simulate clouds. You can even do an animation (hint: you'll need gradients not only in space but also in time)\n",
    "6. Communicate the results (e.g. in the Softuni forum)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: [This](http://flafla2.github.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html) is a very good resource. It can show you both how to organize your notebook (which is important) and how to implement the algorithm."

    "Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise developed by Ken Perlin in 1983 as a result of his frustration with the \"machine-like\" look of computer graphics at the time. Perlin noise is used to produce natural appearing textures on computer generated surfaces for motion picture visual effects. The development of Perlin Noise has allowed computer graphics artists to better represent the complexity of natural phenomena in visual effects for the motion picture industry.\n",

    "Look at the top left square at the picture. There are four corners, and each has defined a fixed 2D vector representing gradient, G¹, G², G³, G⁴. For any pixel P inside we define four vectors representing the difference between the P and each corner, V¹, V², V³, V⁴. Finally, we project gradients G onto vectors V and use bilinear interpolation to transform four numbers into one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each square on the picture contains 4-times more changes in gradient when compared to the previous square. As the number of changes increases, the output is more and more noisy.\n",

    "#### Grid definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Define an n-dimensional grid where each point has a random n-dimensional unit-length gradient vector, except in one dimension where the gradients are random scalars between -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning the random gradients in one and two dimensions is trivial using a random number generator. For higher dimensions a Monte Carlo approach can be used where random Cartesian coordinates are chosen in a unit cube, points falling outside the unit ball are discarded, and the remaining points are normalized to lie on the unit sphere. The process is continued until the required number of random gradients are obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to negate the expensive process of computing new gradients for each grid node, some implementations use a hash and lookup table for a finite number of precomputed gradient vectors. The use of a hash also permits the inclusion of a random seed where multiple instances of Perlin noise are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dot product\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an n-dimensional argument for the noise function, the next step in the algorithm is to determine into which grid cell the given point falls. For each corner node of that cell, the distance vector between the point and the node is determined. The dot product between the gradient vector at the node and the distance vector is then computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a point in a two-dimensional grid, this will require the computation of 4 distance vectors and dot products, while in three dimensions 8 distance vectors and 8 dot products are needed. This leads to the $O(2^{n})$ complexity scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is interpolation between the $2^{n}$ dot products computed at the nodes of the cell containing the argument point. This has the consequence that the noise function returns 0 when evaluated at the grid nodes themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolation is performed using a function that has zero first derivative (and possibly also second derivative) at the $2^{n}$ grid nodes. This has the effect that the gradient of the resulting noise function at each grid node coincides with the precomputed random gradient vector there. If $n=1$, an example of a function that interpolates between value a $a_{0}$ at grid node $0$ and value $a_{1}$ at grid node $1$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x)=a_{0}+\\operatorname {smoothstep} (x)\\cdot (a_{1}-a_{0})\\ \\ {\\text{for }}0\\leq x\\leq 1$$\n",
    "where the smoothstep function was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise functions for use in computer graphics typically produce values in the range $[-1.0,1.0]$. In order to produce Perlin noise in this range, the interpolated value may need to be scaled by some scaling factor."
