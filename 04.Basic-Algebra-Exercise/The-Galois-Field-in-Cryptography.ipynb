    "In mathematics, a field is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined, and behave as when they are applied to rational and real numbers. A field is a fundamental algebraic structure, which is widely used in algebra, number theory and many other areas of mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, a field is a set, along with two operations defined on that set: an addition operation written as $a + b$, and a multiplication operation written as $a ⋅ b$, both of which behave similarly as they behave for rational numbers and real numbers, including the existence of an additive inverse $−a$ for all elements $a$, and of $a$ multiplicative inverse $b^{−1}$ for every nonzero element $b$. This allows us to consider also the so-called inverse operations of subtraction $a − b$, and division $\\frac{a}{b}$, via defining:\n",

    "$$a − b = a + (−b),$$\n",
    "$$ \\frac {a}{b} = a · b^{−1}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, a field is a set $F$ together with two operations called addition and multiplication. An operation is a mapping that associates an element of the set to every pair of its elements. The result of the addition of $a$ and $b$ is called the sum of $a$ and $b$ and denoted $a + b$. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of $a$ and $b$ is called the product of $a$ and $b$, and denoted $ab$ or $a⋅b$. \n",

    "* field of real numbers\n",
    "* field of complex numbers \n",
