    "### ** Problem 7. The Galois Field in Cryptography\n",
    "Research about the uses of the Galois field. What are its properties? How can it be used in cryptography? Write a simple cryptosystem based on the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the following questions to facilitate your research:\n",
    "* What is a field?\n",
    "* What is GF(2)? Why is it an algebraic field?\n",
    "* What is perfect secrecy? How does it relate to the participants in the conversation, and to the outside eavesdropper?\n",
    "* What is symmetrical encryption?\n",
    "* How to encrypt one-bit messages?\n",
    "* How to extend the one-bit encryption system to many buts?\n",
    "* Why is the system decryptable? How do the participants decrypt the encrypted messages?\n",
    "* Why isn't the eavesdropper able to decrypt?\n",
    "* What is a one-time pad?\n",
    "    * How does the one-time pad achieve perfect secrecy?\n",
    "* What happens if we try to use a one-time pad many times?\n",
    "    * Provide an example where you break the \"many-time pad\" security\n",
    "* What are some current enterprise-grade applications of encryption over GF(2)?\n",
    "* Implement a cryptosystem based on GF(2). Show correctness on various test cases"
